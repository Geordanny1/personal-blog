I'm a current student of computer science at [Nothern Essex Community College](https://necc.edu/){:target="_black"}

In this web-site I'm gonna be sharing things relate to my studies and my
general experiences in college. I will aslo problary share whatever comes to my
mind that I think might be useful to someone else, things like emacs or nvim.

My areas of interests are:
- Programming
- Math (completely idiot at this for now)
- Arduino
- Music
- Chess
- Languages
